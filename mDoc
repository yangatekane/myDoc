I have an app that helps to build patient Doctor medical relationship, the app provides a platform for Doctors to take medical history on initial contact, build medical history per patient over time, create and update prescriptions, the doctor can do remote diagnostic by guiding the patient and manage his capacity on daily to monthly basis. The patient is able to take a picture of the infected or affected area of which the doctor can use to update the  prescription or set up a recall date.
